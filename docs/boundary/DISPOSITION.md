# Block-C Boundary Disposition — PhenoVCS

**Repo:** `KooshaPari/PhenoVCS`
**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Charter refs:** [`boundary-shaping.md`](https://github.com/KooshaPari/phenotype-registry/blob/docs/block-c-ssot-2026-06-16/docs/rationalization/boundary-shaping.md) · [`block-c-consolidation.md`](https://github.com/KooshaPari/phenotype-registry/blob/docs/block-c-ssot-2026-06-16/docs/rationalization/block-c-consolidation.md)
**Repo status:** Active (`gh api repos/KooshaPari/PhenoVCS --jq .archived` → `false`)
**Overall verdict:** Single-domain repo (VCS primitives / worktree lifecycle); no decomposition needed.

## Disposition table

| # | Module / path | Disposition | Rationale |
|---|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | `crates/pheno-vcs-core` | **Dynamic-keep** | Core VCS traits/types; thin shim that `worktree-manager` and downstream agent dispatchers will import. Too small and too VCS-domain to justify its own repo. |
| 2 | `crates/worktree-manager` (lib `worktree_manager`, bin `wtm`) | **Dynamic-keep** | Hexagonal git-worktree-lifecycle crate (create / lock / integrate / prune). Main app-layer crate of this repo; coherent, well-scoped VCS boundary. |
| 3 | `worktree-manager:domain` (Worktree, BranchName, CleanupPolicy, errors) | **Dynamic-keep** (within #2) | Pure domain types + PoLA errors, zero external deps per hexagonal design; stays with its owning crate. |
| 4 | `worktree-manager:ports` (WorktreeRepository, BranchOperations, CleanupOperations) | **Dynamic-keep** (within #2) | Hexagonal port traits consumed exclusively by the application service; stay co-located. |
| 5 | `worktree-manager:application` (WorktreeService) | **Dynamic-keep** (within #2) | Use-case orchestration; depends only on domain + port traits. |
| 6 | `worktree-manager:infrastructure` (GitWorktreeAdapter, SimpleFilesystemAdapter) | **Dynamic-keep** (within #2) | Adapters implementing port traits (git subprocess + `std::fs`); replaceable without breaking ports. |
| 7 | `worktree-manager:cli` (clap derive) | **Dynamic-keep** (within #2) | Thin CLI wrapper over application service; ships as `wtm` binary. |
| 8 | `ports/src/vcs.rs` + `ports/src/adapters/{git,jj}.rs` (`Vcs` trait + adapters) | **Dynamic-keep** | Generic VCS hexagonal port with multi-backend adapters; not infra-generic (carries VCS-domain semantics) so does not belong in HexaKit scaffolding. Stays as the multi-VCS-backend interface. |
| 9 | `docs/` (ADR, SPEC, PLAN, journey manifests, operations iconography) | **Dynamic-keep** | Domain-specific docs and test scenarios; not infra-generic, stays with the code it describes. |
| 10 | `.github/` (workflows, issue templates) | **Absorb** (HexaKit scaffolding, future) | Infra-generic CI / governance files present identically in every repo → hoist into HexaKit generated templates per `boundary-shaping.md` doctrine, not hand-maintained N times. **Deferred** until HexaKit template generator reaches parity; keep local copy in the interim. |
| 11 | `.devcontainer/` | **Absorb** (HexaKit scaffolding, future) | Dev-environment config is infra-generic (same rationale as #10); deferred alongside #10. |
| 12 | `scripts/` | **Absorb** (HexaKit scaffolding, future) | Infra-generic automation scripts; deferred alongside #10. |
| 13 | Top-level governance (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE-*`, `SUPPORT.md`) | **Dynamic-keep** | Repo-specific agent contract, contributor guide, security policy, and dual licensing; stays with this repo. |

## Summary

- **0 decompose** — repo is already single-domain; no multi-domain split needed.
- **0 absorb** (active) — no module is better owned by a different existing domain repo.
- **3 absorb** (future / deferred) — `.github/`, `.devcontainer/`, `scripts/` to be hoisted into HexaKit scaffolding per `boundary-shaping.md` doctrine (infra-generic reverse-absorb).
- **No deletions** — per charter, stubs are not delete-on-sight candidates.

## Notes

- `pheno-vcs-core` is currently a minimal stub (one passing test); it will grow VCS-core trait/enum content consumed by `worktree-manager` and downstream agent dispatchers. Its boundary is VCS-domain, not infra-generic.
- The `Vcs` trait in `ports/` serves multiple backends (git, jj); this is intentional multi-adapter pattern within a single VCS-domain boundary, not a decomposition signal.
- Per `block-c-consolidation.md` §2, PhenoVCS does **not** appear in the strategic-merge table. This repo's consolidation story is "keep scoped, hoist CI infra to HexaKit."
